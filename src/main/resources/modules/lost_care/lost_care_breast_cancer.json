    "A very simple and incomplete module that defines a higher likelihood of mortality if breast cancer care is missed. Specifically, this module will check that SNOMED code 33195004 was \"missed\" and is in the lost-care health record using the \"Lost Care\" transition type. If the care was missed, the module will check yearly for whether the person should have a higher mortality rate. This module is not based in fact, a 67% yearly mortality rate for missed breast cancer care is made up."
