### Performance and Functionality Cookies

These cookies allow us to analyze traffic on the site so that we can measure and improve website performance. These cookies are disabled by default and require your permission before they are activated. 

MITRE uses Google Analytics&reg; to measure how users interact with website content. As users navigate between web pages, Google Analytics provides us data, such as applicable URLs, time of visit, time spent on each webpage, type of browser, and type of operating system. With this information, MITRE creates, designs, and updates content based on our user interests. In addition, Google Analytics collects indirectly identifiable information, such as users’ IP addresses, unique IDs, and client IDs. Users who do not want their indirectly identifiable information collected during their visit to our website may opt-out of the Google Analytics tracking service at [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) or keep performance cookies disabled through our cookie settings.
